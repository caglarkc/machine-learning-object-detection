# Football Match Analysis System

## Overview
This system analyzes football match photos and converts player positions into a 2D field view using AI. It detects players and their jersey numbers, representing each player as a point on the field.

## Features
- Player detection and tracking
- Jersey number recognition
- 2D field coordinate transformation
- Team differentiation
- Real-time visualization

## Technical Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- OpenCV for image processing
- YOLO for object detection
- EasyOCR for number recognition
- PyTorch/TensorFlow for deep learning
- Minimum 720p image quality input

## Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
